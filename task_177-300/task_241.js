//
// Scenario
// Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
// The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.
//
// Task
// Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.
//
// Notes
// Array size is at least 1.
// All numbers will be positive.
// Input >> Output Examples
// rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
// Explanation:
// The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.
//
// rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)
// Explanation:
// The first element 120 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 140 is the total weight of team 2.
//
// rowWeights([80])  ==>  return (80, 0)
// Explanation:
// The first element 80 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 0 is the total weight of team 2.
